    "1. **Trace the Deal**  \n",
    "   Add `console.log()` statements inside your `deal()` function to print which card goes to which pile. Watch how decomposition and algorithmic thinking come together.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bug Hunt**  \n",
    "   Intentionally break `canAccept()` (e.g., flip the `+1` and `-1` rule) and see how the game misbehaves. Then, use debugging steps to fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Undo Plan**  \n",
    "   Sketch (or code) how you would implement an `undo()` feature: what data needs to be saved with each move, and how would you roll it back?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Pattern Refactor**  \n",
    "   Take `FoundationPile` and `TableauPile` and extract shared logic into the base `Pile` class. Notice how pattern recognition reduces duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Algorithm Twist**  \n",
    "   Change the `deal()` function to create a ‚Äúreverse Solitaire‚Äù where piles are built from right to left. How does this affect the algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Debugging Drill**  \n",
    "   Write a tiny test that moves a card from one pile to another. Print the length of both piles before and after. Use this to check if `pop()` and `push()` behave correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Stretch Hack**  \n",
    "   Add a simple ‚Äúhint‚Äù system: loop through all piles and log where the top card *could* legally move. This combines abstraction, algorithms, and debugging.\n"

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem-Solving Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Start Small, Build Big**: Every complex system begins with simple components. A single `Card` class becomes the foundation for the entire game.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Divide and Conquer Works**: Breaking Solitaire into cards, piles, moves, and game logic makes an overwhelming project manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Patterns Save Time**: Recognizing that all piles share common behaviors lets you write less code and maintain it more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Skills Developed\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Abstraction Thinking**: Learning to hide complex logic behind simple interfaces (`tryMoveCard()` handles all the messy validation internally).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Algorithm Design**: Understanding that step-by-step processes (like the dealing algorithm) can solve seemingly complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Debugging Methodology**: Developing systematic approaches to find and fix problems rather than random guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transferable Lessons\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Any Complex Project**: These same strategies apply to building web apps, mobile games, or data analysis tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Team Collaboration**: Decomposition helps divide work among team members effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem-Solving Mindset**: Learning to ask \"What's the smallest piece I can solve first?\" instead of \"How do I solve everything?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Software Architecture**: Understanding how small components combine into larger systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Maintainability**: Writing code that's easy to understand, modify, and extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quality Assurance**: Building testing and validation into your development process from the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remember This\n",
    "\n",
    "**Programming isn't about memorizing syntax** ‚Äî it's about developing systematic thinking skills that help you break down any challenge into solvable pieces. Solitaire teaches these skills in a fun, visual way that transfers to any programming project you'll encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next time you face a complex coding challenge, remember the Solitaire approach: decompose, recognize patterns, abstract the complexity, design clear algorithms, and debug methodically. These aren't just programming skills ‚Äî they're life skills.\n",
